# Prostruc: Protein Structure Prediction Tool - Python Package

Prostruc is a command-line tool designed for comprehensive protein structure prediction, leveraging sequence alignment, template-based modeling, deep learning, and validation techniques. With a simple input of either an amino acid sequence or a FASTA file, ProStruc generates high-quality protein structures using cutting-edge algorithms. ProStruc automates the process of blast searches, template selection, structural modeling, and validation, including RMSD, TM-score, and QMEAN.

## Key Features
Accepts input as a FASTA file or a raw amino acid sequence.
Performs sequence alignment and template-based modeling via ProMod3 and BLAST.
Incorporates deep learning-based predictions (ESMFold).
Validates results using structural comparison metrics (RMSD, TM-score) and QMEAN.
Supports Docker integration for handling modeling and validation engines.
Outputs the top-performing models for further analysis and evaluation.
Usage: You can run ProStruc from the terminal with a variety of options to customize the input and output, depending on your use case.

## Basic Commands
###### python prostruc.py --fasta_file  <path_to_fasta>  --job_name <job_name>  --email <email>
###### python prostruc.py --sequence <amino_acid_sequence>  --job_name <job_name>  --email <email>


## Required Arguments
###### --fasta_file: Path to the target protein sequence in FASTA format.
###### --sequence: Input target amino acid sequence directly as a string.
###### --job_name: A custom name for the prediction job.
###### --email: A valid email address to receive model results.

## Additional Details
Prostruc requires internet access for BLAST searches and Docker to run modeling and validation processes.
If no valid templates are found during the BLAST search, the pipeline will exit.

## Example
###### python prostruc.py --sequence "ACFRTY" --job_name "insulin_prediction" --email "user@example.com"

## NB: THE PACKAGE IS ALSO AVAILABLE VIA PIP
###### pip install prostruc
###### prostruc --sequence "ACFRTY" --job_name "insulin_prediction" --email "user@example.com"
