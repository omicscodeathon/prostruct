### Template searching and preparation
Get and sanitize input sequence or file
Perform basic statistical analysis on sequences
Perform blast search to find templates, download the result of the blast search to your local machine so as to avoid too many requests to the server. 
Check for the most similar sequence using either e-value, bitscore or both. Other parameters can be included depending on their relevance
Download the pdb files for the most similar sequences using the ID
Check the header files of sequences for missing residues, if missing residues are found, the file will be deleted. Only files without missing residues will be maintained and used in the modelling step
